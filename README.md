# PyBer Fare Analysis by City Type

##  Overview of Analysis:
This particular analysis is focused on producing a summary of ride-sharing/fare data in areas in which PyBer has drivers and then organizing the data based on city type (i.e., Urban, Suburban, Rural).  Data was read in from both a city data file and a ride data file, merged, and then processed and formatted to provide appropriate analytical data in the form of charts and graphs so that the information may be more readily recognizable and understood.
